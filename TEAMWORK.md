### Timing  
Most work and pull requests have to be submitted by __5PM the day before the due date__ to allow ample review time prior to the deadline.  
### Communication  
Main form of communication is through Slack, primarily for scheduling meetings.   
Github issues can also be used to keep track of project specifics issue.  
For communications, we expect that responses are given within 24 hours.   
Working on the project will be either in-person or on zoom.  
At least a 1 hour meeting (in-person or zoom) for each milestone should be scheduled before the due date .
